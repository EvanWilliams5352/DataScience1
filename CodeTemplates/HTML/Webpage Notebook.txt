<p style="font-size: 15px;">The weird thing is that it's only Young Money. For the past 25 years, there's always been mega-popular labels (e.g., Shady/Aftermath, Rawkus, No Limit, BadBoy) — there were just more of them at one time.This is the current state of hip hop: Young Money has been the top label for each of the past five years. For the first time in hip hop's history, one label has had unprecedented influence. There's one sound and identity dominating the zeitgeist of hip hop. But Young Money's success has more to do with the evolving music industry. Artists don't need the big-budget marketing and distribution of major labels — they start with a grassroots social media following. In 2013, Macklemore famously avoided the label game all together, only signing a distribution deal. Chance the Rapper is still unsigned. Fetty Wap recently signed a deal with <strong> 300 Entertainment </strong>, but out how to stay relevent in a world that needs them less. Sometimes that means staying small. <strong>XL Recordings</strong> (Adele, M.I.A.. FKA Twigs) is one potential model, who keeps its roster small and typically releases no more that six albums a year </p>
