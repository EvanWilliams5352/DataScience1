    <p style="font-size: 15px;">In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 15px;"> Lil Wayne's ascent is the story of <strong>Cash Money</strong>. The Dirty South starts with <Strong>LaFace Records</Strong>. The east-coast/west-coast feud is <strong>Bad Boy vs. Death Row</strong>. In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 15px;"> We wanted to surface the notablee labels in hip hop history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard ( collaborating with <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinBeacham">Kevin Beacham</a> of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment">Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction. </p>
