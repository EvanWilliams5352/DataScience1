                <p>It's hard to mess up a chocolate chip cookie. In the 80 years since the treat's <br> invention, thousands of recipe variations have been written to make the treat more <br> gooey, crispy, chewy and generally tastier than its predecessors. Yet, it's possible <br> that this go-to dessert's tastiness can be pushed even further.</p>
                <p>We wondered if there was a way to leverage computers and hundreds of pre- <br> existing recipes to create the most <i>average</i> chocolate chip cookie. Would it be bland <br> and unremarkable? Or, perhaps like averaging human facial features, the results <br> would be even better than each of its individual parts. Maybe an average cookie <br> would be the most delicious of them all.</p>
                <p>But what is an average cookie? We decided to interpret this idea using three <br> different methods: a mathematical average, predictive text algorithms, and neural <br> networks. After feeding each algorithm over 200 chocolate chip cookie recipes, <br> they each generated something new. And, yes, we actually baked them.</p>
